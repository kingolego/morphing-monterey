        <p>This year, 2020, marks 250 years since the official founding of Monterey, the capital of Alta California.
          In 1770 Captain (later Royal Governor) Gaspar de Portolá and Father (later Saint) Junípero Serra established
          a permanent fort (the Royal Presidio) to block Russia’s southward progression from Alaska.
          Spain’s new colony of Alta California did block Russia but doomed the hunter-gather society of the indigenous peoples.
          The continuous chain of missions from San Francisco to San Diego transformed the ecology of California
          by the introduction of cattle and horses and supporting grasses.
          Hides and tallow wrung from cattle by the labor of natives made up California’s trade for almost a century.
          Then the gold rush changed everything.
        </p>
        
        <p>Monterey lost the capital and then even the county seat and hasn’t stopped changing yet.
          During the last 100 years many new communities have arrived in Monterey to draw upon the riches of the land & sea
          and to enjoy the climate & location.
          The Chinese for abalone & salmon, the Sicilians for sardines and the military for the year-round climate are a few examples.
          Now tourists and retirees are the new “gold”.
        </p>
                
        <p>During 2020 Monterey will celebrate its

            “Bold Past & Golden Future”
          </a>
          with parties and re-enactments and perhaps even attempts to learn the lessons of history and to look forward.
          This talk will sketch the momentous changes of the first 100 years
          and also the continuing changes of the 20th century
          and suggest ways for members to participate, learn and enjoy the 250th anniversary.

        </h3>
        <p><em>Marvelous Mike</em> hasn't morphed as much as Monterey, but then he's not yet 250 years old!
          He still thinks like an economist, but enjoys his retirement as an amateur historian and chef.
          He “produced” the Bicentennial Re-enactment of the Battle of Monterey in 2018
          and is a member of the City of Monterey’s Museum and Cultural Arts Commission.
